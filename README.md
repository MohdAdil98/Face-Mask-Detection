# Face-Mask-Detection
WHAT

1-It is a computer vision application which can detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not and then store their data who are not wearing the mask.

2-This application can get data from various sources such as
IP Camera, WebCam, onlinevideo.

3-This is a web application which can be accessed over a LAN.

4-The IP Camera is a wireless survelliance camera which can send footage to the wifi network to which it is connected then if the computer which contains the application is also connected with the same wifi network , then we will be able work on that footage data into our project and detect mask.

WHY
1-This application can be used in many places such as hospital , Research labs , Polluted Areas , Air borne Pandemic
